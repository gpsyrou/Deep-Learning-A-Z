# Deep-Learning-A-Z

## Notes from the course Deep Learning A-Z provided by Udemy.


**Description of the Examples**:

1) **Bank Customers**

    **Task 1 - Create the Artificial Neural Network**
    
    Predict which customers are most likely to leave a specific bank(binary classification problem). 
    For this task we used an Artificial Neural  Network with 11 feautures and 1 output Layer. The final accuracy of the model was 86.25%, without any evaluation technique(and thus not that relevant to the reality as the model needs tuning). 
    The code can be found <a href="https://github.com/gpsyrou/Deep-Learning-A-Z/blob/master/bank_customers_pred.py"> here </a>.
        
    **Task 2 - Evaluate,Improve and Tune the ANN**
  Tune and improving the ANN constructed in Task 1.
